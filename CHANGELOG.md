# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow Semantic Versioning for app version strings
(`app/main.py` / `GET /health`).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Governance files: `agents.md`, `spec.md`, `roadmap.md`, tracked `context.md`,
  and this `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Live `.github/` from former templates: CodeQL workflow, pyright in CI
  (report-only until backlog cleared), markdownlint (non-blocking).
- Optional verified recovery email (username separate from email; SMTP-gated)
  — merged PR #38; human-confirmed with MailerSend SMTP.
- `tools/send_test_email.py` SMTP smoke CLI (PR #49).
